# Demo Delivery Project

## Overview
The Demo Delivery project is a logistics web application designed to facilitate efficient vehicle management and item tracking for delivery services. Built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, it provides a user-friendly interface for managing vehicles and their associated items.

## Features
- **Vehicle Management**: Users can add, view, and manage vehicles, including details like fuel capacity, plate number, and type.
- **Item Tracking**: Each vehicle can have multiple items associated with it, allowing for easy tracking of deliveries.
- **User -Friendly Interface**: The application features a clean and responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to provide feedback during item addition and vehicle management.

## How It Works
Users can navigate through the site to view available vehicles and their details. They can add new vehicles and items, which are stored in a MySQL database. The application utilizes Spring Data JPA for data persistence, ensuring efficient data management.

This project aims to streamline logistics operations, making it easier for businesses to manage their delivery processes effectively.
